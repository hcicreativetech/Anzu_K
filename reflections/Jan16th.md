Papert's paper described qualitative thinking or knowledge with the example of Physics class. In the Physics class, many equations are used to explain natural phenomena. Computers are introduced class and shows notion of velocity. From this showing notion of velocity from the computer helps students learning natural phenomena. The author calls this learning process as qualitative experience or knowledge. In my experience, there was a positive learning experience which was experiments. For example, I generated oxygen from water with electrolysis and physics experiments that measure the time and distance that ball moves. This learning phenomenon with experiment is so much more fun and rememberable than repeating to write English vocabulary and Chinese characters. In my experience, not like Papert's example, the computer was not used to show natural phenomena but with using actual materials, I was able to learn natural phenomena and its notion.
