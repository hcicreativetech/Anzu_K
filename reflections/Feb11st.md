The Makey Makey (which we experimented with in the previous class) is a technology for making user interfaces. Using the Makey Makey as an example, discuss its benefits and limitations as a prototyping technology and as a technology for conducting research through design. Compare your evaluation of the Makey Makey with how prototyping and research through design are presented in the respective readings.

There are some benefits of making with Makey Makey. First, numerous example codes and applications on the web are provided and these help beginner to develop artworks and prototypes easily and in a short time. Next, the hardware is easy to use. There is no complicated hardware configuration and then it helps us using it without reading any long explanation documents. There are also some limits in using Makey Makey to make the user interface. First, when we expand the function to the prototype of Makey Makey, we need to add it and it needs complicated programming. For example, when we need to add a vibrator for output tactile sensation, we need to add the vibrator and some other hardware to it and it sometimes needs complicated programming. In addition, the type of sensor and hardware that can use for Makey Makey is limited. 

In the literature, the evaluation was conducted from 4 points. These 4 points are Process, Invention, Relevance, and Extensibility. In my evaluation, I evaluated with Invention, Process, and Extensibility. However, I did not evaluate with Relevance.
