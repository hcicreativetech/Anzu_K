In this paper, the authors describe an overview of how to evaluate toolkit based on the past 68 papers about toolkit. The toolkit is composing of programing and hardware set to craft certain artwork and prototype with technology. They raised four evaluation points which are demonstration, usage, technical evaluation, and heuristic evaluation. 

-	Demonstration: Demonstration is to show what the toolkit support and how people can work with it. The goal of the demonstration is to clarify what is the capability of the toolkit to build an application.

-	Usage: Usage helps verify ‘who can use the toolkit’ under certain circumstances, which tasks or activities can a target user group perform, and which problems remaining as challenging.
 
-	In technical performance, researchers can evaluate the technical performance of the toolkit to find out how well it works. The goal of the technical performance is to benchmark and quantify or analyze toolkit or components to verify the performance.

-	Heuristics are a method to investigate usability informally. The goal of heuristics to show where the toolkit is needed and creating paths of least resistance. We use a checklist, discussion, and basing usage studies on heuristics in this method.

Based on the evaluation method shown by paper, in my experiences, I used to evaluate my developed device by demonstration, usage, technical performance, and Heuristics. It was not a toolkit but my tactile devices can provide a sense of touch and render texture easily so, it aims for anyone to use my device in creating fruitful tactile experiences in Virtual Reality and Augment Reality. In the actual evaluation, first, we recorded videos and made paper to show demonstration, usage, and technical performance. We also conducted a performance experiment to check the usability of the devices. Like this, we also evaluated with Heuristics.
