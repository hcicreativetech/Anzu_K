In the Schon’s paper, the author described AI application in designing. In the designing tool with AI, the designers seeing – moving – seeing, the appreciation of design qualities, the evolution of design intentions, storing and deploying prototypes are essential. In computer-based design, the system helps people to produce computer environments that enhance the designer’s seeing-drawing-seeing, provide a system that extends the designer’s repertoire of the prototype. I agree that the computer enhances the environment that humans can create prototypes and support them. In my experience, when I used 3D print, the software automatically adds the supports to the parts not to break during 3D printing. I have no expertise and do not know how to add sport not to break my 3D printing stuff. It is very helpful. I think in the future, the AI add some advice for making strong construction per materials during designing and modeling 3D object.
