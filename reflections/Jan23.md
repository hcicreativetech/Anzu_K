# Reflection: January 23st

SFischer defines four dimensions of social creativity: Spatial, Temporal, Conceptual Within Domains, Conceptual between Domains, and Technological. Thinking back to a collaborative experience you directly participated in, select one of these four dimensions and describe specific barriers or opportunities that you encountered in your personal experience.

## Social creativity: turning barriers into opportunities for collaborative design.

My personal experiences working with people is that course project in Soft Robotics course. In the project, we developed “Social hand” that a hand moves with the soft actuated material and make hand gesture. In the course project we have several challenges.

In the spatial dimension, we had big fire in California so, in the end of the course, I could not see members in our group. We developed together. One lab member made software side and I needed to make hardware side. In the end of the course, we needed to combine our work but it is difficult to see them. So, our project was delayed a lot.
In the temporal dimension, we had not spent the time to decide the work because every member has their strength. Also, our group has only two member and I already know the members very well and my group member did not complain about her task.
In the conceptual with domains, we sometimes had struggle between ideal complement and actual stages. For example, I knew the programming to let machine work well, but my group member did not know how to move the machine. One group member did not know how difficult to manipulate the machine and she always asked me to very difficult task. The gap between the ideal and actual limitation was happen. Therefore, I had to negotiate her the limitation and share my thinking. In conceptual between domains and technological, we had to require interacting with the computer because we need to manipulate machine with computer. We also had several course and it was busy too. When we had to program, we were sometimes very tired and we could not work very well.
