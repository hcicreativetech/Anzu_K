Resnick and Rosenbaum motivate their principles for tinkerability with regards to the opportunities tinkerable systems provide for learning and education. Discuss how tinkering is or is not relevant to professional practice, or expert-level production.

## Tinkerability

Tinkering is playful and developing creation such as Scratch, MaKey Makey, and Legos. It sometimes has a bottom down style to think. In the expert level creation, I easily come up with a music synthesizer. When I watch the video that shows the musician making sound or song, they use a synthesizer to make these. Synthesizer has a graphical interface and based on the interaction of the hand they can make sounds. Also, playing an instrument and poetry is seems to tinker. These tinkerings give the expert to think more creatively and enjoyable in their creation. Also, they can form their creative freedom. On the other hand, when they practice and sophisticate tools, tinkering is not related to their practice because practice is sometimes the repetition of motion. If they use the same tool or method, because of the repetition, there is no affordance to tinkering.
