In the review paper, the creativity was reviewed from different levels of the analysis such as Neurological, Biological basis, Psychology, gender difference, Social Psychology. There are some interesting statements. For example, the creative person is typically the focus of experimental paradigms, case studies, or questionnaire-based investigations. In the paper of Creative Support Tools, the authors described what user activities need support. For example from some literature suggested that opportunity, delineation, program definition and generating ideas are important. They also adopted a framework with 4 activity in a creative activity such as collect, relate, create and donate. In the paper of Trouble with Creativity shows the domain-specific problem. Some research showed much more like expertise then intelligence.

I agree that people use the opportunity and generating ideas in creative support. When I participate in Hackathon in Japan, host people organized Hackaton to making useful tools or services with internet clouds. They provided Raspberry Pi and a free cloud. Because of this opportunity, I was able to create a new tool with Rasberry Pi and Cloud.
