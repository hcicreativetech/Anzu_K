# Reflection: January 21st

Select an example of a favorite medium or material you’ve used at some point in your life. In line with the ideas of affordance and/or textility, describe the creative processes imposed by your selected medium. Bring an example of the medium to class on Tuesday (photograph, physical sample, etc.)

## Abstracting Craft: The Practiced Digital Hand. Chapter 7: Medium

My favorite media is “TECHTILE toolkit”. TECHTILE tool kit is a media that can record the sense of touch and playback it. It is originally presented by the haptic researcher in Japan. Specifically, it captures the tactile signal from the surface and provides vibration from vibrator. For example, we can attach the sensor to the bottom of paper cup and we can record the vibration and play back sensation from a vibrator attached another cup. When I was undergrad student, I met the media in the tactile workshop. I was really fun of using this TECHTILE toolkit because I found that there are lot of affordance that enable to expand creativity using sense of touch. What I actually did is that I created a lot of kind of sensation with this devices. In the creative process, I actually touched the surface and explored the sense of touch, first. Next, when I find the our favorite sense of touch, we can record it and mix the several sense of touch. Through the process, I could find wired sensation that I could not experience in my life. In addition, the vibration is the audio signal so, I computed the audio filter with the audio software such as Matlab, Max msp. I used created sense of touch to the another tool or surface presentation. For example, I provided vibration from cheek and transmited sense of eating. Also, I attached pen and change the sense of touch during writing. This media changed my life and it is a reason that I am engaging in the tactile research.
