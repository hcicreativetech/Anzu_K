Both readings center on the challenges of understanding (or empathizing) with the experience of others. They communicate fundamental limitations in the ways in which designers can effectively empathize with those outside their own experience. How do these challenges align with your own experiences in creative production or collaboration? Are there scenarios in which you have felt unable to understand the experience of a person you were designing for or working with? Alternatively, how have your own experiences biased you towards valuing some forms of knowing or production over others?


-	How do these challenges align with your own experiences in creative production or collaboration?

In the collaboration, I have taught and made tea in the tea ceremony club with blind people. The Japanese tea ceremony has complicate procedures and difficult tools to make tea. To understand their ability is one of the challenges as the reading described. For example, when we make tea, we need to pour hot water into the cup. I felt anxious about their safety because Iâ€™m not sure if they can pour hot water without hurt. Also, the tools are also complicated to deal with.  However, if I do many things for them, it is not good to learn for them. So, I helped minimize procedures for them.

-	Are there scenarios in which you have felt unable to understand the experience of a person you were designing for or working with?

No. However, it is hard to understand to know their ability. I closed my eyes and imagined which part is unable to do for them. In addition, I asked them which part hard and which part is needed to help from me. I did a maximum effort into empathy.

-	Alternatively, how have your own experiences biased you towards valuing some forms of knowing or production over others?

In this case, production is tea but some forms of knowing are this empathy and efforts that making tea with various people. I think this form of knowing is more valuable than tea. This experience provides me a lot of learning to imagine and understand people. In the near future, when we have a collaboration with impaired people, also by myself, I will do the maximum effort to imagine my own ability and taking action for them and myself for better collaboration.
