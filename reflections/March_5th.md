# Final project description

- complete the 1-2 paragraph description of your planned final project idea.

Tactile texture rendering is very difficult so, non-specialist of haptic need to learn special methods and computer language to render tactile texture. Here, in the lab, we developed the tactile effector device that allows the non-specialist of haptics to render various tactile texture.

I am going to use this device in the classroom. We would like to investigate if the device really works for the non-haptic specialists (students) to help them to render tactile texture and create their own application with it. 

In the method, I will use questionary and ask them to make creative applications with our device in the activity. 

At the beginning of the activity, we will ask how familiar with tactile rendering, how much they know the tactile rendering, and how difficult to rendering textures. In the activity, we instruct how to use our devices and ask them to make an application with it.
From it, what kind of application is created and after the activity, we use questionary to ask.

From this investigation, we would like to know if our devices help the non-specialists of haptic to create their own texture rendering, and how this rendering method connects to their creativity from their work.

This is a similar workshop paper but it is in the book, so I would like to know the target journal or conference.

What age group are you aiming for? - Age does not matter but they should be none-expert of rendering tactile texture.
What activity are you writing about? - I'm going to write about like above.
What do you think you want your target audience is (teachers, grad students in positions like you, faculty, etc.)?  - Haptic Researchers, Grad students, Faculty who introduce texture rendering in the class.
